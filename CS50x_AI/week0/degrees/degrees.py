    Lots wrong with this. I haven't coded in a while.
    For one thing, the connection depth should be an attribute of each node as they come up in the frontier, because they will be check at different depths at different times.
    And I'm not sure if this is related, but my exhausted actors list is repeating names, because of multiple movies in common with source actor
    AND and, it gets first connections, but not later ones, so I think the problem is in the frontier population after "neighbors_for_person"
