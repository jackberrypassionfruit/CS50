                    <p> Our names are Jack and Kate, and in 2003 we both had the idea to open a sustainably run, non-profit seeking cupcakes company out of our grandmother's library. Since then we've revived the economy of Deer Lane, and are looking to expand!</p>
                    <p> Please support us either by buying some of our delicious cupcakes, or by signing up for our newletter here.</p>

                    <p>We were inspired by our love for the hypothetical dog that we always wanted but never got, and we channel that love into each and every cupcake that we make.</p>

            <p><em>As Jack and Kate's older cousin, I have a lot of reason to be biased in favor of the family cupcakes. In fact, it'd really be silly of me to say anything but a glowing endorsement of them and their hard work, because there's a lot of good karma coming back to me in return. Just last week I told Kate that her hair looks nice, and she gave me agreat recipe for Shakshuka and gave me advice on a date. She even gave me some cupakes to take on the date, and Sammy and her friends liked them a lot. I'm seeing her next Saturday for a hiking trip or a day at the museum or something.<br> <br>What did you ask me about again? Anyway, the cupcakes are  pretty great!</em></p>
